# Recommendations with IBM

### About dataset
This dataset was provided by IBM, it contains information of users interacting with articles. 
In this project, we would like to build recommendation system that helps predict user intention
toward articles. There are two major dataset in this project.

- user-item-interaction : record user interaction with articles
- articles_community : record content of articles

###  I. Exploratory Data Analysis
In this part, we explore the dataset to have a general insight to our data.

### II. Rank Based Recommendations
In this part, we try to make rank based recommendations based on popularity of articles.

### III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
In this part, we try to give recommendations based on behavior of similart users. We build 
user-item matrix and analyze similarity among users.

### IV. Content Based Recommendations 
In this part, we try to make recommedations from content of the articles

### V. Matrix Factorization
In this part, we run SVD(sigular value decomposition) and adjust the amount of latent features
to get optimal number of latent features.

### VI. Extras & Concluding
